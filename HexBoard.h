      * 1. Add the start_coord to the stack, and mark as visited
      * 2. While the stack is not empty do:

      *   a. Peek the top of the stack (call it curr_cell)
      *   c. Use chooseNeighbour to choose the neighbour to visit
      *   d. If the neighbour exists, for that neighbour (call it neigh_cell) do:

      *     i. Link curr_cell with neigh_cell
      *     ii. Set neigh_coord to be visited
      *     iii. Update the neigh_cell's path distance
      *     iv. If necessary, update length of longest path so far (longest_path_dist)
      *     v. Update the end coordinate only if its path distance to start is strictly greater
      *     vi. Push neigh_cell into the stack

      *   e. Otherwise (if chooseNeighbour returns nullptr), pop the stack.

      * @param branch_prob Specifies how often it should "branch out" when choosing neighbours.

      *                    A large branch_prob means neighbours of a different radius (diff dist from the centre) are preferred
